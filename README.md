# Individual vs. group dynamics: Impacts on equilibrium states in self-organizing systems
Paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231225012470

## Highlights
- An individual-based dynamic model that can capture local relationships.
- A memory mechanism as a regularizer to enhance the model’s dynamic responsiveness.
- Comprehensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the model’s performance.
